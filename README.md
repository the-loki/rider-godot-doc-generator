This project is used to generate localized documentation for the JetBrains Rider Godot plugin.

## Project Introduction

This project translates Godot's XML documentation to specified language versions through GitHub Actions and generates an SDK suitable for the Rider Godot plugin. It uses Godot's official translation files (.po files) to translate XML format documentation, then builds the corresponding documentation through PHP tools in the JetBrains godot-support repository.

## How to Use

### Changing Language

To generate SDKs in different languages, you need to modify the language code in the workflow file:

1. Edit the [`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`](.github/workflows/python-app.yml) file
2. Find the global environment variable setting on line 13:
   ```yaml
   env:
     GENERATE_LANGUAGE_CODE: zh_CN
   ```
3. Replace `zh_CN` with your desired language code
4. After saving the file, push to the repository to automatically trigger the build process, generate the corresponding language documentation package, and create a Release

## How to Use the Generated SDK

Download the generated compressed package and extract it. Find the GdScript directory of the Rider plugin and replace the contents of the `extracted` folder.
